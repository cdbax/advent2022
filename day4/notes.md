# Day 4 Notes

I shot myself in the foot with this puzzle, which took a little bit
to figure out. I had an off-by-one error as a result on not properly
understanding how the `Range` type worked. To solve it I just had to
add one to the max value when creating the range.

I feel like I used `recover` for the first time here with some kind
of intent, and a feeling that I knew what I was doing. I wouldn't
say I'm properly understanding RefCaps yet, but I'm gaining a little
more understanding of how to work through the problems I hit with them.
